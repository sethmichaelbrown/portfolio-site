I have worked with individual clients looking for a website for their small business, non-profits, and large companies looking to move away from bulky and costly solutions like Wix. Clean aesthetics, ease of use and navigation, powerful capabilities, and clear communication during the build are goals I strive for on every project. Please feel free to check out my GitHub account or get in contact about your project. I look forward to hearing from you.'
